# Machine Learning Path

Getting started with any new field could be a really overwhelming task. Specially if the field is Machine Learning or Data Science. There are thousands and thousands resources of Machine Learning. People write hundreds of blogs daily about the path one should follow to become a Data Scientist in 6 months, 3 months, 1 month and even 1 day. 

So, how is this one different? 

Crework is different because of the following reasons:

1. We believe that education should be free, hence all the knowledge and resources we share are free or are at minimal cost. We ourselves don't charge any money for providing resources/guidance to students. 

2. We are super cool because we are nerds. We are people who started in a field other than computer science but finally ended up spending 60% of our day either writing code or reading other people's code. Wanna be like us? Mail us [here](mailto:creworkgroup@gmail.com) anytime.

3. All the resources have been compiled by our team on the basis of our own experience. These are the resources that we used ourselves to gain the knowledge of Machine Learning and AI. We are constantly learning so the resources also get updated time to time. 

Now, after the introductions, let's get to the main agenda. From where should you start? 

### The Prerequisites:

The most important prerequisite for Machine Learning is Mathematics. Ever heard the term probability? Do you know what a hypothesis is? Have you ever calculated the slope of a curve? 

If you said Yes to any of the question above, you are ready to start. The topics would be

1. Statistics and Probability
2. Linear Algebra
3. Calculus
