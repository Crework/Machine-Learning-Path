# Machine Learning Path

Getting started with any new field could be a really overwhelming task. Specially if the field is Machine Learning or Data Science. There are thousands and thousands of resources of Machine Learning on the internet. People write hundreds of blogs daily about the path one should follow to become a Data Scientist in 6 months, 3 months, 1 month and even 1 day. 

So, how is this one different? 

Crework is different because of the following reasons:

1. We believe that education should be free, hence all the knowledge and resources we share are free or are at minimal cost. We ourselves don't charge anything for providing resources/guidance to students. 

2. We are super cool because we are nerds. We are people who started in a field other than computer science but finally ended up spending 60% of our day either writing code or reading other people's code. Wanna join us? Mail us [here](mailto:creworkgroup@gmail.com) anytime.

3. All the resources have been compiled by our team on the basis of their own experience. These are the resources that we used ourselves to gain the knowledge of Machine Learning and AI. We are constantly learning so the resources also get updated time to time. 

Now, after the introductions, let's get to the main agenda. From where should you start? 

### The Prerequisites

#### Mathematics

The most important prerequisite for Machine Learning is Mathematics. Ever heard the term probability? Do you know what a hypothesis is? Have you ever calculated the slope of a curve? 

If you said Yes to any of the question above, you are ready to start. The topics would be

1. Statistics and Probability
2. Linear Algebra 
3. Calculus

Pro Tip: If you think you have intermediate knowledge of all the topics mentioned above, you can skip the maths part for now and come back to it later as your work demands. 

#### Python

Even if you haven't coded a single "Hello World" before this, we have got you covered. 

If you want to do Machine Learning, Python is the most popular and useful language for that. Do one out of these two courses given below.

[Introduction to Computer Science with Python by MIT (Class Lecture Videos)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63WbdFxL8giv4yhgdMGaZNA)

Now, as we are done with the prerequisites, let's get to the good stuff. 

### The Introduction

Getting started with Machine Learning is overwhelming due to two reasons:

1. The field is competitive, there are lots of people doing ML at different levels.
2. It is vast and almost never ending, you might feel like you will never learn enough. 

But we have the solution: START NOW!!!!!

Yes, so here is what you need to do roughly:

1. Start Python, learn all data structures of python. 
2. Learn important libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
3. Start any theory video lectures course from Youtube or Coursera and complete it. 
4. Learn about Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering
5. Start playing with data and doing projects. 

Damn, that sounds like a lot. I won't lie to you, it is. But as you know "It is what it is", so you don't have a choice like we didn't. You must be wondering about the resources, don't worry, we have got you covered.
